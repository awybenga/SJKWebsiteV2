        <header>Indigenous Reconciliation Fund Collection</header>
        <p>
            This weekend (May 7/8, 2022), <a href="files/2022 Pastoral Letter to Parishes, re Indigenous Reconciliation Fund, May....pdf">Bishop Crosby's Pastoral letter</a> outlining our Diocesan contribution to the Indigenous Reconciliation Fund is being read at all Masses.
            The Diocese of Hamilton has committed $4 million to the Canada-wide $30 million pledge toward healing and reconciliation initiatives. Over and above that $4 million, all parishioners in the Diocese are invited and encouraged to
            engage with and support annual collections to the fund. Envelopes are being distributed this weekend, and our first annual collection will be taken up next weekend, May 14th and 15th.
            <br /><br />
            These contributions will be a sign of our commitment to walk with the First Nations, Metis and Inuit Peoples of our land. Please be generous as we stand in respect of their resiliency, strength, and wisdom,
            while listening to and learning from one another. Please prayerfully consider a contribution.
            <br /><br />
            All donations are eligible for charitable receipts which will be given through the parish. Therefore, please write cheques payable to St. Joseph Church, with “Indigenous Reconciliation Fund” in the memo field.
            <br /><br />
            For more information, please see the <a href="files/Frequently Asked Questions - IRF.PDF">Frequently Asked Questions</a> document.
