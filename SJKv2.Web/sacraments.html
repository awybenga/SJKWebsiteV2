            At least once of the parents must be a practising Roman Catholic here at St. Joseph's, registered
            for at least 9 months, or living within the area of this parish.  Baptisms are done every third
            Sunday of the month.  Forms are available in the office.

        <header>First Eucharist</header>
        <span>
            Starting in grade 2, children who have already been baptized prepare for First Holy Communion and First Reconciliation together. 
            This catechesis takes place in a partnership between the home, parish, and school if the child attends a Catholic elementary school. 
            Preparation begins in the fall, and both sacraments are usually celebrated in the spring. 
            If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:stjosephkitcheneryouth@gmail.com">Mary Forcier</a>

        <header>Confirmation</header>
        <span>
            Confirmation is the completion of our Baptism. We are sealed with the Holy Spirit, and equiped for life as Catholic Christians.
            Confirmation is celebrated with youth in or above grade 7, always during Mass at a time given by the Bishop’s office.
            This generally takes place in the spring, with formation throughout the school year to prepare candidates to receive the grace of the sacrament.
            For those in Catholic schools, the preparation is in partnership with the elementary school.  For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:stjosephkitcheneryouth@gmail.com">Mary Forcier</a>
