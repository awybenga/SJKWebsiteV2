            for at least 9 months, or living within the area of this parish.  Baptisms are done every third

        <header>First Eucharist</header>
        <span>
            Starting in grade 2, children who have already been baptized prepare for First Holy Communion and First Reconciliation together. 
            This catechesis takes place in a partnership between the home, parish, and school if the child attends a Catholic elementary school. 
            Preparation begins in the fall, and both sacraments are usually celebrated in the spring.

        <span>This year, families can choose between monthly sessions at St Anne on Sunday evenings or St Joseph on Monday evenings from 6-7 pm. You may choose the location and date that best suits you, regardless of which church or school you attend. <i>Your First Eucharist Mass will be at your own parish.</i></span>
        <span>Our hope is to hold these in the church, with a virtual option for those unable to come in person. Plan to attend the same preparation evening (Sunday or Monday) all year. Here are the dates you need to know.</span>

        <header>Confirmation</header>
        <span>
            Confirmation is the completion of our Baptism. We are sealed with the Holy Spirit, and equiped for life as Catholic Christians.
            Confirmation is celebrated with youth in or above grade 7, always during Mass at a time given by the Bishop’s office.
            This generally takes place in the spring, with formation throughout the school year to prepare candidates to receive the grace of the sacrament.
            For those in Catholic schools, the preparation is in partnership with the elementary school.  For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com">Mary Forcier</a>

    <p>In addition to our online sessions, we will also be sending home a monthly conversation guide for candidates to complete with their sponsors. This will be a combination of a short scripture passage, questions to ask one another, and opportunities for prayer. You may choose the time and mode of your conversation (Facetime, phone call, Zoom, etc.), but it should be a conversation, and not done by email or text.</p>
    <span>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shift and change, we are making every effort to adapt and adjust our Sacramental preparation process. We were able to successfully and safely celebrate First Communion and Confirmation in October and November, following all protocols carefully.
