        <header>Vacation Bible School 2022: CAVE QUEST</header>
        <img src="files/CaveQuestLogo_LR.png" alt="Logo Image with text. Cave Quest. Following the light of Jesus" />
        <p>
            Registration for this year's <u>in person</u> Vacation Bible School is now open for children finishing Junior Kindergarten through grade 5. <b>This half-day camp will run from 9 am to 12:30 August 8-12</b> at St Anne Church for both St Joseph and St Anne Churches.
            <br /><br />
            Our theme this year is Cave Quest. We'll spelunk (the official word for cave exploration) through 5 days of music, games, science projects, prayer and great snacks as we follow Jesus, the Light of the World! After a 2 year COVID hiatus, we are so excited to be back in person.
            <br /><br />
            Registration is now open at <a href="https://bit.ly/cavequest22" target="_blank">bit.ly/cavequest22</a>, and we also have paper copies of the registration form at both churches. Our suggested donation this year is $40, but a donation is not required to participate.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Youth Volunteers Needed</b>
            In addition to adventurers to fill our 'Cave Crews,' we are also looking for youth <b>finishing grades 6-12</b> to run stations, lead small groups, present the day's themes, and more. VBS is a great way to gain experience for future summer jobs, spend time with kids and other youth volunteers, and have a LOT of fun. Whether your thing is science, music, sports, art, hanging out and talking, or making snacks, we need you! We offer training ahead of time, and volunteers return to this program year after year.
            <br /><br />
            Please email <a href="mailto:mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com">mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com</a> for more information about volunteering.
