        <header>First Eucharist</header>
        <span>
            Starting in grade 2, children who have already been baptized prepare for First Holy Communion and First Reconciliation together. 
            This catechesis takes place in a partnership between the home, parish, and school if the child attends a Catholic elementary school. 
            Preparation begins in the fall, and both sacraments are usually celebrated in the spring.

        <header>Confirmation</header>
        <span>
            Confirmation is the completion of our Baptism. We are sealed with the Holy Spirit, and equiped for life as Catholic Christians.
            Confirmation is celebrated with youth in or above grade 7, always during Mass at a time given by the Bishop’s office.
            This generally takes place in the spring, with formation throughout the school year to prepare candidates to receive the grace of the sacrament.
            For those in Catholic schools, the preparation is in partnership with the elementary school.  For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:stjosephkitcheneryouth@gmail.com">Mary Forcier</a>

This will be a combination of a short scripture passage, questions to ask one another, and opportunities for prayer. You may choose the time and mode of your conversation (Facetime, phone call, Zoom, etc.), but it should be a conversation, and not done by email or text.</p>
