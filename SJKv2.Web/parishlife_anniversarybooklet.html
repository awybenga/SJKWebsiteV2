        <h4>1930-1980</h4>
        <p>
            St. Joseph&#39;s parish community,
            celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding in 1980 with a
            week long celebration September 20-28.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Joseph&#39;s RC Church,
            Kitchener, could well be called a monument to its founding
            pastor, the late Msgr. Reuben M. Haller, who was the first
            diocesan priest to serve in Kitchener, and in 1959 became the
            first priest in the city to be made a monsignor while serving
            the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            (In 1971 he officially opened
            the Msgr. R. M. Haller School on Shea Crescent, the first
            separate school in the Region to be named after a living person.
            The school was built on property that was originally a part of
            St. Joseph&#39;s parish, which in the 1930&#39;s encompassed an area
            that today includes St. Anne&#39;s, St. Aloysius and St. Francis
            parishes.)
        </p>
        <p>
            It was during the Depression in
            September, 1930, that the most Rev. J. T. McNally, D. D., fifth
            bishop of Hamilton, created the new parish and assigned Father
            Haller the herculean task of building the church. St. Joseph&#39;s
            was the third Catholic church to be built in Kitchener. The
            first two were St. Mary&#39;s and Sacred Heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the fall of 1930 the
            construction of a basement church was underway and by Christmas
            the first mass was offered. Prior to that services were held at
            St. Joseph&#39;s separate school, which was built in 1921. (It
            wasn&#39;t until 1953 that upper structure of church was completed.)
        </p>
        <p>
            When St. Joseph&#39;s was founded in
            1930, of the 215 parishioners, 85 heads of families were
            unemployed. Yet, despite having difficult times, the
            parishioners pitched in to raise money and donate time and
            energy to help the infant church.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1953 a convent for the School
            Sisters of Notre Dame was established on Madison Avenue. Due to
            a decrease in religious vocations, the convent was sold in 1970.
            Now known as &quot;Madison House&quot;, it is used by the Children&#39;s Aid
            Society as a testing and evaluation centre for children in
            distress (1980).
        </p>
        <p>
            The School Sisters of Notre Dame
            taught at St. Joseph&#39;s School for many years. They gave
            invaluable service in caring for the altar and altar linens.
            Sister Edwardine was the first principal at St. Joseph&#39;s
            separate school.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sister Servants of the
            Immaculate Heart of Mary taught at St. Bernadette&#39;s school.
            Sister Joachim was its first principal.
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;The success of our parish is
            the family spirit of working together,&quot; said Msgr. Haller, who
            prided himself as &quot;being a working man&#39;s priest.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            When Msgr. Haller retired in
            1968 after serving as pastor for 38 years - longer than any
            other priest in Kitchener - he turned a debt free parish over to
            his successor, Rev. L.P. Cullaton, who was pastor until 1975.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rev. Harold Smith, a former
            associate pastor, succeeded Father Cullaton and remained until
            his retirement in 1978.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rev. Charles Schefter became
            pastor in 1978 of the parish which now comprises 1,200 families.
            In the fall of 1978, Rev. Manuel Lourenco, O.H. was assigned to
            the parish to care for the spiritual welfare of the Portuguese
            families in the K-W area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Msgr. Haller continued as pastor
            emeritus until his death November 11, 1979 at the age of 90.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our current Pastor (1980), Rev.
            Charles Schefter, has been pastor of St. Joseph&#39;s parish since
            1978. He is a native of Guelph. A member of Sacred Heart parish
            there, he was educated at Sacred Heart Separate School and
            Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute. He studied for the
            priesthood at St. Augustine&#39;s Seminary, Toronto, and was
            ordained May 26, 1956, at the Cathedral of Christ the King by
            Bishop Joseph F. Ryan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following his ordination Father
            Schefter was assistant pastor at St. Andrew&#39;s Oakville, St.
            Basil&#39;s Brantford, and St. Lawrence, Blessed Sacrament and St.
            Eugene Churches, all of Hamilton.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was then appointed pastor of
            St. Francis Xavier Church, Carlsruhe, with missions at St.
            Peters, Ayton and St. Joseph&#39;s, Neustadt. Then prior to coming
            to St. Joseph&#39;s Kitchener, he served as pastor for six years at
            St. Mary&#39;s, Elora with a mission at St. Joseph&#39;s, Fergus.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his two years at St. Joseph&#39;s
            parish, renovations have been made in the hall, including a new
            side entrance to the church and hall, and St. Joseph Parish
            Advisory Council has been established.

        <h4>60 Years Working Together To Build Our Community by Rosemary Singleton</h4>
        <p>
            St. Joseph&#39;s Parish community
            celebrates the 60th Anniversary of its founding this year with a
            two day celebration, October 27th and 28th, 1990. St. Joseph&#39;s
            Parish could well be called a monument to its founding pastor,
            the late Msgr. Reuben M. Haller, who was the first diocesan
            priest to serve in Kitchener and in 1959 became the first priest
            of the city to be made a Monsignor while serving the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another first for the prelate, a
            native of Cambridge (Preston) was the significant tribute paid
            to him by the Waterloo County Separate School Board in 1971 when
            it named the new separate school in recognition of his
            &#39;tremendous&#39; service to Catholic education. It was the first
            school named for a living person by the board. The school was
            built on property that was originally part of St. Joseph&#39;s
            parish, which in the 1930&#39;s encompassed an area that today
            includes St. Anne&#39;s, St. Aloysius, and St. Francis parishes.
        </p>
        <p>
            St. Joseph&#39;s was the third
            Catholic church to be built in Kitchener. <br />
            The first two were St. Mary&#39;s and
            Sacred Heart. <br />
            It was established during the
            Depression, a time of harsh unemployment and much need.
            <br />
            In September, 1930, the most Rev.
            J. T. McNally, D.D., fifth bishop of Hamilton, created a new
            parish and assigned Father Haller the herculean task of building
            the church. <br />
            Undaunted, the jovial priest
            tackled the task, and his 215 families pitched in to help, even
            though 85 heads of families were unemployed and eighteen lost
            their homes. <br />
            That unselfish, caring spirit still
            reigns in the parish families.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite having difficult times,
            the parishioners pitched in to raise money and donate time and
            energy to help the infant church. In the fall of 1930, the
            construction of a basement church was underway and by Christmas
            the first mass was offered. Prior to that, services were held at
            St. Joseph&#39;s separate school, which was built in 1921. (It
            wasn&#39;t until 1953 that the upper structure of the church was
            completed.)
        </p>
        <p>
            When Msgr. Haller retired in
            1968 after serving as Pastor for 38 years -- longer than any
            other priest in Kitchener -- he turned a debt free parish over
            to his successor, Rev. L. P. Cullaton, who was pastor until
            1975. &#39;The success of our parish is the family spirit working
            together&#39;, was the creed of the ecumenically minded Monsignor
            Haller. His ecumenism enfolded many people of other
            denominations. All of them, regardless of race or creed, would
            receive a helping hand. &#39;God love you&#39; was his blessing after
            daily mass and in greetings to all. Diversified in his service
            to the community, he served in military and hospital
            chaplaincies and in the field of education and health. Although
            he served his community well, his first concern was always his
            parish.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important part of our parish
            history involves the work of religious sisters. The School
            Sisters of Notre Dame taught at St. Joseph&#39;s School fo many
            years. The late Sister Edwardine was the first principal at St.
            Joseph&#39;s School. Following her retirement in education, she
            founded a visitation program to senior citizens and nursing
            homes. For such humanitarian efforts on behalf o f the
            community, she was named a &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. Also, playing a
            prominent role in the formation of students were the Sister
            Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. They taught at St.
            Bernadette&#39;s School for several years. St. Joachim was its first
            principal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Monsignor Haller serviced the
            church for 64 years, 46 years in Kitchener. He retired in 1968
            but still served as pastor emeritus until his death at 90,
            November 11th, 1979. His successor, Father Cullaton, was
            followed by Rev. Harold Smith, a former associate pastor who
            remained until his retirement in 1978. Rev. Charles Schefter was
            pastor between 1978 and 1982. During this time, Father Manuel
            Lourenco was assigned to the parish to care for the spiritual
            needs of the Portuguese families of the K-W area. In 1982,
            Father Leo Sepal was assigned as pastor until 1987 when he was
            succeeded by Father Don Sanvido, presently stationed at St.
            Joseph&#39;s.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the life history of our
            parish is so closely tied to the life of Monsignor Reuben
            Haller, much good has been done by all the pastors, associates,
            and religious leaders who have worked with the laity at St.
            Joseph&#39;s Parish.

        <header>St. Joseph's Choir and Organists</header>
        <p>
            From its inception, when it was
            only a basement church, St. Joseph&#39;s has had a choir envied by
            other parishes. As in other things, what success the choir
            enjoyed was due to its directors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest organist/directors
            that come to mind were Clare Massel and Bob Sobisch. Then, in
            the mid-1930&#39;s, the then director, Agnes Fischer, put together a
            choir which was excellent and featured some marvellous voices.
            From memory the following are recalled: Frank Mantell, Tom
            Livingstone, Ann Prust, Scotty Berwick and Ed Eckert.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a time, after St. Joseph&#39;s
            parish was divided, and new churches sprang up, the choir was
            decimated in numbers -- three adults accompanied by school
            children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ara Baliozian, a skilled
            organist, came to St. Joseph&#39;s over a decade ago, and can be
            heard Sundays at early Mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            A new format in of choir
            director/organists joined us beginning with Joyce Schnarr from
            1980-1986, during which time the choir expanded to fifteen
            members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carol Ditner took over from 1986
            - 1989, and still is available to us during vacation periods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, our director is Karen
            Kunda, who attended grade school at St. Joseph&#39;s, and whose
            father was Frank Mantell, a choir member in the thirties.
        </p>

            If enthusiasm, good-will,
            co-operation and enjoyment are a measure of success, then
            today&#39;s choir has achieved that goal.
