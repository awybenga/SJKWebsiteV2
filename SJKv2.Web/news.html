        <header>Vacation Bible School 2022: CAVE QUEST</header>
        <img src="files/CaveQuestLogo_LR.png" alt="Logo Image with text. Cave Quest. Following the light of Jesus" />
        <p>
            WOW! We've had such an incredible response to this year's Vacation Bible School that we are now full!
            There are 60 young campers ready to spelunk (the official word for cave exploration) through 5 days of music, games, science projects, prayer and great snacks as we follow Jesus, the Light of the World!
            VBS runs August 8-12 from 9-12:30 in St Anne Parish Hall for children connected with both St Anne and St Joseph Churches.
            <br /><br />
            A small waitlist is being created: please contact our VBS director Mary at <a href="mailto:mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com">mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com</a> to add your name.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Youth Volunteers Needed</b>
            We are still looking for a few more <b>youth finishing grades 6-12</b> to run stations, lead small groups, present the day's themes, and more. VBS is a great way to gain experience for future summer jobs, 
            spend time with kids and other youth volunteers, and have a LOT of fun. Whether your thing is science, music, sports, art, hanging out and talking, or making snacks, we need you! We offer training ahead of time, 
            and volunteers return to this program year after year.
            <br /><br />
            Please email <a href="mailto:mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com">mforcier@hamiltondiocese.com</a> for more information about volunteering.
            <br /><br />
