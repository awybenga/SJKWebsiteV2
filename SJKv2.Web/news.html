            Dear fellow parishioners,
            <br /><br />
            There is much thought and discussion these days about the recent discovery of unmarked graves of 215 innocent children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in B.C.
            <br /><br />
            We are all horrified that such a crime could have been committed; we are sensitive to the pain that the survivors are suffering; we are praying for the victims and for the survivors who continue to suffer such trauma and injustice; we are angry at attempts to cover it up; we are sorry that this has happened and had been allowed to continue for decades, and we are especially sorry and dismayed for the involvement of the Catholic Church, and, yes, for what seems to have been no public expression of sorrow from officials of the Church. So many emotions!
            <br /><br />
            But there is one thing that is definitely needed, and that is <b>MORE AWARENESS</b>.
            <br /><br />
            We need to be educated in this "cultural genocide", to take an interest in this dark period of our Canadian history and to own it, to admit it, and its implications for present-day difficulties, to know what happened and why so that it may never be repeated again. Instead, moving forward, may we listen to diverse cultures and voices and learn from one another.
            <br /><br />
            The attached is just a small contribution to this gradual process of learning -- a serious learning opportunity that would be quite serious and suitable. It is a free, online "course" offered by the University of Alberta. You can register at
            <br /><br />
            <a href="http://www.coursera.org/learn/indigenous-canada">Coursera</a>
            <br /><br />
            Of course, there are many opportunities locally to learn from our Indigenous neighbours.
            Please let our anger and shock turn to action and prayer for all.
            <br /><br />
            Blessings.
            Fr. Brian
