    <p>The One Heart, One Soul Campaign is an initiative by the Diocese of Hamilton to help build up its parishes. The goal is for each parish to raise funds, the majority  of which will go back to the parish for their chosen projects. The remaining funds will go towards supporting shared ministries within the Diocese (i.e. prison ministry, campus ministry, etc.) as well as to parishes in need.</p>
    <p>St Joseph is part of the 3rd wave of parishes to launch the campaign. We hope to follow the lead of the parishes in the past two waves who have already completed their campaign and have seen great success, even amidst the pandemic. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.oneheartonesoul.ca">www.oneheartonesoul.ca</a></p>
    <p>Thank you in advance for any support that you can offer! If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the parish and we will put you in touch with our campaign leadership team. Please visit our parish specific page at <a href="https://www.oneheartonesoul.ca/stjosephkitchener">www.oneheartonesoul.ca/stjosephkitchener</a> for more information, including our Parish goals</p>
    <p>Here is a message about the campaign from Fr Brian Quigley, MCCJ</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.oneheartonesoul.ca/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

    <h3>Why are we still doing the campaign? With the virus, shouldn’t we be focused on other priorities?</h3>
    <p>From the beginning, this campaign has been primarily about strengthening our parishes. Because of the pandemic, our parishes have even greater needs than when we started. Because the campaign is in place, we are in a better position than almost any diocese in North America to help our parishes recover from the blows suffered from COVID-19. The campaign offers parishes the opportunity to better fulfill their missions. There is no greater priority than that.</p>

    <h3>How can we ask for money from people who lost their job or are otherwise hurting financially because of the virus?</h3>
    <p> We certainly are very sensitive to the struggles parishioners are facing, whether related to the virus or not. That’s why we work with pastors and leaders at parishes to set and review request amounts. That process will be even more important throughout the rest of the campaign. It is not foolproof, though. Pastors do not know every parishioner’s situation. But there is never an intention to be insensitive to a parishioner’s suffering. Meanwhile, some parishioners are in a position to give now, and they want to help. The campaign gives them the opportunity to help and the confidence of knowing how the money will be used. Be assured that only those who are able to give are expected to do so, and ultimately the decision is between the donor and the Lord.</p>

    <p>The campaign is founded on stewardship, our belief that we give back in gratitude a portion of what we’ve been given by God. Stewardship isn’t just for the good times in life, when we can give easily; it’s for all times, including the bad. We may adjust how much we give, or to whom we give, but we continue to give – in gratitude for and in proportion to what we’ve been given. A truly sacrificial gift demonstrates our trust that God will provide what we need, though not necessarily what we want. Stewardship isn’t what KEEPS us from getting through the tough parts of life; it’s what HELPS us get through them.</p>

    <h3>​Where will donors send their gifts, and where will the money be kept?</h3>
    <p>Donors’ gifts and pledges wil­­l be held in trust for the parish and initially kept in a dedicated diocesan account. The Diocese will disburse the parishes’ funds to them after the payments have been received and the parish is ready to undertake their projects. The campaign’s Clergy Committee has worked with the Diocese to outline when the funds will be distributed to the parishes.</p>

    <h3>Why can’t I just support my parish directly?</h3>
    <p>Frankly, we hope you continue to support your parish directly through your regular Sunday giving. This campaign is not intended to divert funds that go toward normal operating needs. The campaign is a special effort to meet needs that go beyond the routine and that can help to set up parishes (and the Diocese) to thrive for years to come. In short, supporting this campaign is supporting your parish directly – as well as other parishes in need and various diocesan ministries.</p>

    <h3>What kind of financial transparency can we expect during the campaign and beyond?</h3>
    <p>Transparency is a top priority for the Diocese. Summaries of diocesan financial reports from 2012 through 2019 are on the diocesan website, and copies of the full reports are available from the Diocese’s financial office. Regular updates of campaign goals, projects and fundraising will be communicated during the campaign through a number of avenues – the website, emails, social media, to name a few.</p>

    <h3>How can I make a gift or pledge to the campaign?</h3>
    <p>There will be a number of ways to make a gift or make payments on your pledge to the campaign, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting up a pre-authorized gift (automatic withdrawal) from a chequing account</li>
        <li>Setting up a recurring credit card payment</li>
        <li>Paying by cash or cheque through the mail</li>
        <li>Making a stock or securities transfer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These choices are outlined in the pledge package sent to your home, and online at <a href="https://www.oneheartonesoul.ca">www.oneheartonesoul.ca</a></p>

    <h3>Is there a campaign website?</h3>
    <p>Yes –  <a href="https://www.oneheartonesoul.ca">www.oneheartonesoul.ca</a>. It has many more Frequently Asked Questions, information about the parishes that have already conducted the campaign, a campaign video and much more. Give it a look!</p>
