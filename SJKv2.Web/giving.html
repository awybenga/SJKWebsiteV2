            <p>Responding generously to what we have been given by God is a hallmark of Christian discipleship. Giving faithfully, and sacrificially enables our parish community to fulfill the mission of the Church: and bring about an important transformation within our hearts and minds. In this way, the God who is never outdone in generosity brings to life the beautiful words of the Prayer of St. Francis: “For it is in giving that we receive.”</p>

        There are several ways to contribute financially to St Joseph.

        <h2>Envelopes</h2>
        <p>Numbered envelopes are available to all registered parishioners, allowing the parish to offer you a tax reciept at the end of each year. You will recieve a box of dated envelopes to bring with you to Mass and offer in the collection basket during the Preparation of the Gifts*. If you would like to begin using envelopes, please contact the parish office.</p>

        <p>*During the COVID-19 pandemic, collection baskets for bills, coins, and envelopes will be available as you exit the Church. There will be no collection during Preparation of the Gifts. If you are not able to attend Mass in person, you may drop off your envelope at the office, or call to make alternate arrangements.</p>

        <h2>Pre-authorized Giving (PAG)</h2>
        <p>PAG allows you to provide your Sunday offering through scheduled transfers from your bank account directly into the account of the Parish. You provide authorization to the Parish to debit your account a specified amount, and the Parish initiates these transfers based on what you agreed. You hold complete control of your offerings.</p>

        <h3>What are the Advantages of Pre-Authorized Giving?</h3>

        <p>For the Parish: St. Anne Parish will benefit from receiving your contributions more dependably, and regularly. If you happen not to be at Mass for any reason, the parish continues to receive your offering. This enables our Parish to plan pastoral programs and activities more effectively, with the confidence of knowing that our income will be reliable throughout the year. Finally, it reduces paperwork for the Parish Office and allow us to put time and energy toward other priorities.</p>

        <p>For the parishioner: You will benefit from the convenience of having your offerings automatically deposited into the Parish’s account, without having to place money or a cheque in the collection each week. Most of all, though, it gives you the opportunity to re-think your giving. Rather than giving from what’s left over, PAG encourages you to discern your level of Parish support and to respond more fully to the call to belong to your Parish with greater intention.</p>

        <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
        <p>Pre-authorized gifts will be processed once a month and on the same day of the month for all, the 15th. This significantly reduces the administrative impact on the Parish office staff and it ensures that bank fees remain low. The customized authorization form, approved by the Diocese, makes it easy to determine and report your monthly offering.</p>

        <p>Our PAG brochure includes program information, the enrollment form, space to to provide banking information or attach a blank check, and authorization for the Parish to debit your account. The PAG Schedule is where you specify the ammount and frequency of your PAG. The completed forms can be placed in the collection. dropped off, or mailed to the Parish. Note the two paragraphs that explain the rights of parishioners who authorize PAG and your recourse in case of difficulty. This language complies with federal legislation surrounding pre-authorized payments, and cannot be amended in any way.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about PAG or would like more information to investigate a pre-authorized giving plan, please feel free to contact us. The forms linked below are also available in hard copy at the Parish Office.</p>
