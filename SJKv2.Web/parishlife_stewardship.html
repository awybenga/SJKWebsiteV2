            Dear Parishioners,<br /><br />
            Our parish thrives because we have many volunteers.  Some serve the needs of the parish; others reach out to the
            wider community. We have 30 groups and more than 100 parishioners involved in the life of our faith community.
            Take a look at the parish ministries briefly described below.  Read these prayerfully and consider how God may be
            calling you.<br /><br />
            There is something for everyone! Sometimes it can be hard work, but always rewarding. Following diocesan guidelines,
            some ministries require a reference and a police check. If you have any questions about a ministry, phone the parish
            office at 519-745-9302. Office hours are 9:00 am-4:00 pm. Please join us in being good stewards of God’s many gifts. You will be richly blessed.
            <br /><br />
            Yours in Christ!
            <br /><br />
            Fr. Tom and Fr. Brian
